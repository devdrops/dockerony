# 1 to 2

Between version 1 and 2, the php image has been split into 3 images :

- a base `php` image for the two others with packages and configurations that
  should be present in both;
- a `php-fpm` image, to be used as upstream by the webserver;
- a `php-console` image, to be used to run commands and tests.

Migrating is quite simple, just follow these steps :

1. Duplicate the appserver container definition and name that definition
   `console`. Make it use the `php-console` image.
1. Change the `DNSDOCK_IMAGE` variable to `console`.
1. If you need to access the webserver container in your tests, add a link to
   this container.
1. Change the appserver container definition so that it uses the `php-fpm` image.
1. Remove the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable from it.
1. Check your CI script for references to the appserver container, and change
   them to the console container.
